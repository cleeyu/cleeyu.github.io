Christina Lee Yu is an Assistant Professor at Cornell University in the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering. Prior to Cornell, she was a postdoc at Microsoft Research New England. She received her PhD in 2017 and MS in 2013 in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the [http://lids.mit.edu Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems]. She received her BS in Computer Science from California Institute of Technology in 2011. She received honorable mention for the 2018 INFORMS Dantzig Dissertation Award. She is a recipient of the 2021 Intel Rising Stars Award and a JPMorgan Faculty Research Award. Her work is supported by grants from the National Science Foundation and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. Her research interests include algorithm design and analysis, high dimensional statistics, inference over networks, sequential decision making under uncertainty, online learning, and network causal inference.
